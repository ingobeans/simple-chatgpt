Just a basic WebUI for ChatGPT access. Doesn't require OpenAI API key, uses another website for the API (which means that anything sent to chatgpt can't be considered particularly secure).
Uses model gpt-3.5-turbo-0613.

Packages required to install: flask, markdown-it-py, bleach

Can be installed with: `pip install flask markdown-it-py bleach`
